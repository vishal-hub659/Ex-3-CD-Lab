# Ex-3-RECOGNITION-OF-A-VALID-ARITHMETIC-EXPRESSION-THAT-USES-OPERATOR-AND-USING-YACC
# DATE : 18/02/2026
# REG NO : 212224040365

# AIM
To write a yacc program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operator +,- ,* and /.
# ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the operators =,+,-,*,/ and for the identifier.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc –d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter an arithmetic expression as input and the tokens are identified as output.
# PROGRAM
l.file
```
%{
#include "y.tab.h"
%}

%%

"=" {printf("\n Operator is EQUAL");} 
"+" {printf("\n Operator is PLUS");}
"-" {printf("\n Operator is MINUS");} 
"/" {printf("\n Operator is DIVISION");}
"*" {printf("\n Operator is MULTIPLICATION");} 
[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]* {
printf("\n Identifier is %s",yytext); return ID; }
. return yytext[0];
\n return 0;

%%

int yywrap()
{
return 1;
}


```
```
%{
#include<stdio.h>
%}

%token A ID

%%

statement: A'='E

| E {

printf("\n Valid arithmetic expression");

$$=$1;

}

;

E: E'+'ID

| E'-'ID

| E'*'ID

| E'/'ID

| ID

;

%%

extern FILE*yyin; main() {
do { yyparse();
}while(!feof(yyin)); } yyerror(char*s)
{

}


```

# RESULT
A YACC program to recognize a valid arithmetic expression that uses operator +,-,* and / is executed successfully and the output is verified.
